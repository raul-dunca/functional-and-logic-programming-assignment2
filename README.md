# Assignment 02
In Prolog:
- a) Replace all occurrences of an element from a list with another element e.
- b) For a heterogeneous list, formed from integer numbers and list of numbers, define a predicate to determine
the maximum number of the list, and then to replace this value in sublists with the maximum value of sublist.
Eg.: [1, [2, 5, 7], 4, 5, [1, 4], 3, [1, 3, 5, 8, 5, 4], 5, [5, 9, 1], 2] =>
[1, [2, 7, 7], 4, 5, [1, 4], 3, [1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 4], 5, [9, 9, 1], 2]
